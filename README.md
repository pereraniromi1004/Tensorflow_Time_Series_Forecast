# Tensorflow_Time_Series_Forecast
Time series forecasting using Tensorflow core

The time series forecasting is carried out using TensorFlow. It builds a few different styles of models including Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs).

This is categorized  in two main parts, with subsections:

Forecast for a single time step:
1. A single feature.
2. All features.
Forecast multiple steps:
1. Single-shot: Make the predictions all at once.
2. Autoregressive: Make one prediction at a time and feed the output back to the model.
